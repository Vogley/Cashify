# Cashify
A COE 1530 Software Engineering Project

This is a web application that helps a user keep track of their spending with different categories.
There are three main finacial tools, one for budgeting, one for tracking, and one for prediction. 

To run the web application, use Flask. Make sure the FLASK_APP is set to "test_frontend" as this is the main Python file.
The website works best on Google Chrome, but is responsive any should fit to any sized monitor.
